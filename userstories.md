# User Persona: Kim
Kim is a 19-year-old University student who is receiving therapy treatment for anorexia.

### User Journey
Kim is at the Student's Union, enjoying a coffee break with some of her classmates. They don't know that she is recovering from an eating disorder and Kim would prefer to keep it private, and to keep the conversation light.
After drinking her latte, Kim takes out her smart phone and uses the Nourish app to record what she has eaten, and how it made her feel.
From the landing page on the app, she clicks the "log a meal" button, which then prompts her to answer a few simple questions. This takes her under 10 seconds and feels effortless and familiar.
She can then join in with the conversation seamlessly.

# User Persona: Ali
Ali is a 23-year-old office assistant who is receiving therapy for bulimia.

### User Journey
Ali is in the middle of a therapy session. The therapist wants to know how many meals Ali has managed to keep down since they last saw each other.
She gets the data she has from Ali's Nourish account to appear on her computer screen. They can both see a correlation between Ali vomiting and feeling stressed out.
She helps him to rationalise his thoughts and come up with some coping strategies for the next time he feels stressed.
Ali records these tips in the Nourish app at the end of the therapy session so that he can refer back to them later.
